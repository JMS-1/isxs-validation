Experimental validation helper based on [JSON Schema definitions](https://json-schema.org) using [DJV](https://www.npmjs.com/package/djv).
Currently only a very basic implementation which allows to convert the Schema to [Mongo's \$jsonSchema](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema).
